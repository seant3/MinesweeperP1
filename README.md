Minesweeper!

Description: Minesweeper is typically a logic based game, but this iteration is just guessing and hoping you come out alive. There are no hints to guide your path, other than the tallies on the left side of the screen (indicating how many total mines and how many remaining "free spaces" until you win). Imagine this as actually trying to walk across a mine field, and all you have are those two tidbits of information!

Technologies Used:

* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

Getting Started:

Click here to play - [Minesweeper](https://seant3.github.io/MinesweeperP1)

The only pertinent instructions are...take a step(click) and hope you survive.  Reference the left panel for information on mines and spaces remaining before you win.

Next Steps:

1. Make the game more logical based:
   * Add numbers to the clicked square to reference how many bombs are touching - this will allow the user to have some knowledge before stepping forward.
   * Create randomized boards so that the mines will move
2. Difficulty Levels
   * Choose how large the grid will be, which will in-turn increase the amount of mines
3. If you click a non-mine space, open a grid of spaces for free until it reaches a mine.  Display the outer rim's proximity to mines.
